# HexgridPrototype
 This is a prototype for a Tile Placer game using Hexagonal Tiles (similar to Dorfromantik).
 
 The primary goal of this project is to establish a clear workflow and architecture design that enables efficient development of the full game within a reasonable timeframe. To achieve this goal, a solid stack of specialized tools will accelerate the design process, including:
 - custom inspector tools for creating new tiles

- custom visual scripting nodes to prototype new design ideas in real-time
